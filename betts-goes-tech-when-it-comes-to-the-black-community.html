                                <p>LOS ANGELES — Technically
                                    speaking, Cassie Betts is a geek.</p>



                                <p>The founder of the tech company <a href="http://www.district2.co/">District2.Co</a> and the founder and CEO of
                                    <a href="http://misla.org/">MISLA</a> (Made in South LA) doesn’t run away from the moniker. In fact, it’s part of her self-description that she admittedly wears like a badge of honor.
                                </p>

                                <p>“Yes, I’m a geek,” said
                                    Betts, who was born in Inglewood, moved to Pontiac, Illinois before moving to
                                    Honolulu and eventually back to Los Angeles. “I’m a nerd and that’s OK. It
                                    works for me.”</p>



                                <p>Founded in 2013,&nbsp;District2.Co&nbsp;is a business-to-business tech company that connects
                                    brands and designers with factories to better automate the manufacturing
                                    process. The company came out of both&nbsp;the South Los Angeles incubator
                                    through Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation and Silicon Beach’s
                                    Stubbs Alderton &amp; Makiles Precelerator (a program for startups).</p>



                                <p>MISLA, designed to bring
                                    stimulus to Betts’ community is an urban economic accelerator that trains
                                    underrepresented minorities in web development, software engineering and other
                                    forms of digital literacy.</p>



                                <p>“I started MISLA as a result of the current political and economic
                                    state of affairs,” Betts said. “Hashtags like&nbsp;#blacklivesmatter and
                                    #aDayWithoutImmigrants have brought&nbsp;the minority struggle to the forefront
                                    of American politics in recent years.”&nbsp;</p>



                                <p>A huge fan of technology,
                                    robots, computers and calculus, Betts, a divorced, single mother of two boys
                                    began her road to all that was technical when she was young. By the time she
                                    was 9, she had already taught herself how to code, mostly because she wanted to
                                    play computer games.</p>



                                <p>“My father told me if I
                                    wanted to play them, I had to program them into the computer.”</p>



                                <p>That knowledge would prove
                                    to be invaluable as Betts, a serial entrepreneur who attended a six-week boot
                                    camp at Code District (a web and mobile app development company), would
                                    eventually use coding on several projects.</p>



                                <p>“Attending Code District
                                    was the greatest decision of my life,” said Betts, who got her entrepreneurial
                                    spirit honestly. Her father, a one-time Illinois state trooper, also had a real
                                    estate business.</p>



                                <p>“He was&nbsp;extremely
                                    prolific in investments,” Betts said. “When I was 11, I helped
                                    my dad manage the business. We had more than 150 units. I took care of all the
                                    administrative work, collected rent, dealt with complaints and sent maintenance
                                    people to fix repairs.”</p>



                                <p>It turned out, that the
                                    “maintenance” team was basically Betts and her family.&nbsp;</p>



                                <p>“We did everything,” she
                                    said. “We painted, fixed the plumbing, and did the electrical work. I
                                    absolutely hated this life, but I definitely learned a lot. It was preparing
                                    me. It formed the foundation for my life as a serial entrepreneur.”</p>



                                <p>In 2000, after graduating
                                    from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, Betts started a
                                    clothing line and a photography business. A career in fashion had been a dream
                                    of hers ever since she was a kid.</p>



                                <p>Although she’s not one for
                                    “clocking in,” and even though she doesn’t like cubicles, Betts threw herself
                                    into the fashion industry because she wanted to work her way up the corporate
                                    ladder. She worked with designer Jerry Leigh on his kids’ designs. While there
                                    she created a jeans line for Boom Boom Jeans, a junior fashion brand under Blue
                                    Planet.</p>



                                <p>Once on the inside of the
                                    business, she quickly noticed that the industry’s technology was outdated. Her
                                    goal was to upgrade the manufacturing process. Eventually, she realized the
                                    need for sourcing manufacturers, which led to the launch of&nbsp;District2.Co.&nbsp;</p>



                                <p>There was a method to her
                                    madness. Betts, 41, had a plan. Her role all along, as she saw it, was and
                                    still is to advocate for women and minority-owned businesses.</p>



                                <p>“What really pushed me was
                                    when I got into tech in 2013, there were hardly any women and even less black
                                    women,” Betts said. “Most of the time, I would be the only black person in the
                                    room. That would happen at 98% of the events I went to. I’ve always been about
                                    Black Girl Magic. I’m that person.”</p>



                                <p>Betts got where she is
                                    today because of other women of color “hooking” her up with information on
                                    financing, funding and resources.</p>



                                <p>Admittedly, her life, at times
                                    was rocky.</p>



                                <p>Homeless at 19, Betts
                                    credits several local organizations with helping her find her way and get on
                                    her feet.</p>



                                <p>She slept on friends’
                                    couches, in a car at a mechanic’s shop, on bus stop benches and cardboard boxes
                                    — sometimes while still attending high school.</p>



                                <p>Eventually, she got into acting and modeling in Coca-Cola&nbsp;commercials as well as television and film. Those breaks allowed her to continue her dream. She hasn’t looked back.</p>



                                <p>She became a founding
                                    member of Black Women in Tech.</p>



                                <p>“I want to make sure there
                                    is a seat at the table for us,” she said.</p>



                                <p>She also co-produces Urban
                                    Tech Connect — an annual tech conference headed by Plugin South LA, and
                                    is&nbsp;a volunteer pitch coach and lead consultant for the Youth
                                    Entrepreneurial Challenge put on by the Vermont Slauson Economic Development
                                    Corporation.</p>



                                <p>From 2014-16, she partnered
                                    with the Positive Results Co. and the Soledad Enrichment Action to create a
                                    youth initiative that gives inner-city youth on-the-job training. The center
                                    was located on the second floor of a building on Manchester Boulevard and
                                    Vermont Avenue.</p>



                                <p>“[County Supervisor] Mark
                                    Ridley Thomas gave the school $50,000 to aesthetically design the second floor
                                    and for technology and design,” Betts said. “We did coding, made commercials
                                    and we trained the youth in the school and from the neighborhood.</p>



                                <p>In a 2017 article, Forbes magazine
                                    called her “The Woman Turning South LA into Startup Land.” She is
                                    the&nbsp;promoter and visionary behind the South LA Best Buy Teen Tech Center,
                                    scheduled to open this summer in partnership with the Vermont Slauson Economic Development
                                    Corporation, Annenberg Tech, and PledgeLA.</p>



                                <p>And she’s not done yet.
                                    Betts, who writes a secret blog on dating and is involved in a travel website
                                    for black women, is always looking for ways to increase her profile and that of
                                    the community she champions.</p>



                                <p>“We
                                    have plans to launch a tech accelerator to provide funding, and services to
                                    existing and new startups in the South L.A. community,” Betts said. “Our aim is
                                    to decrease the tech diversity gap, increasing economic stability within
                                    poverty-stricken communities and battling the effects of gentrification.”</p>
